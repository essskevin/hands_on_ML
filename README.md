# Hands-On Machine Learning — Theory & Practice

This repository contains Python notebooks with both **theoretical explanations** and **practical exercises** based on the book:

📘 *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*  
by Aurélien Géron

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside

The notebooks cover key topics in **machine learning** and **deep learning**, including:

- Fundamentals of machine learning
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Model evaluation and tuning
- Neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow
- Convolutional and recurrent networks
- Production-ready ML workflows

Each notebook blends **concise theoretical notes** with **hands-on code examples** and experiments.

## 📁 Structure

Notebooks are named and ordered following the structure of the book.

## 📚 Purpose

This project is intended as a personal study tool and reference. It follows the book closely but may include additional insights, comments, and code variations.

## 📜 Disclaimer
This repo is not an official companion to the book. All content is for educational purposes only.
Full credit to Aurélien Géron for the original book and examples.

Let me know if you'd like a version in **Italian**, or tailored to a specific chapter or learning goal (e.g., only deep learning topics).
